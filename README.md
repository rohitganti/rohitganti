### Hi :) 


**rohitganti/rohitganti** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am an upcoming sophomore at the University of California- Irvine, double majoring in computational Physics and data science. I am deeply interested in Machine Learning and its applications across various fields and its problem-solving capabilities that could one day change the world. I am interested in applying deep learning neural networks in fields such as physics and medicine for a more accurate analysis of big data which could solve many more problems that can change the world.
